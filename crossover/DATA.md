We detail data download and release instructions for preprocessing with scripts for ScanNet, 3RScan, ARKitScenes & MultiScan. 

- For dataset download + data preparation, please look at [README.MD](prepare_data/README.MD) in `prepare_data/` directory.

### Generated Embedding Data
We release the scene level embeddings created with CrossOver on the currenly used datasets in [GDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12vn5CCvnI9zagFyYrGzLLlMPTgF7rndW?usp=sharing), which can be used for cross-modal retrieval with custom data as detailed in demo section.

- `embed_scannet.npz`: Scene Embeddings For All Modalities (Point Cloud, RGB, Floorplan, Referral) in ScanNet
- `embed_scan3r.npz` : Scene Embeddings For All Modalities (Point Cloud, RGB, Referral) in 3RScan
- `embed_multiscan.npz` : Scene Embeddings For All Modalities (Point Cloud, RGB, Referral) in MultiScan
- `embed_arkitscenes.npz` : Scene Embeddings For All Modalities (Point Cloud, RGB, Referral) in ARKitScenes

    "mask" : "modality_name" : "True/False whether modality was present in the scan"
    },

  ]
}
```

## :wrench: Data Preprocessing
In order to process data faster during training + inference, we preprocess 1D (referral), 2D (RGB + floorplan) & 3D (Point Cloud + CAD) for both object instances and scenes. Note that, since for 3RScan dataset, they do not provide frame-wise RGB segmentations, we project the 3D data to 2D and store it in `.npz` format for every scan. We provide the scripts for projection. Here's an overview which data features are precomputed:

- Object Instance: Referral, Multi-view RGB images, Point Cloud, & CAD (only for ScanNet)
- Scene: Referral, Multi-view RGB images, Floorplan (only for ScanNet), & Point Cloud 

We provide the preprocessing scripts which should be easily cusotmizable for new datasets. Further instructions below.

### ScanNet

#### Running preprocessing scripts
Adjust the path parameters of `Scannet` in the config files under `configs/preprocess` (remember to adjust the path of `Scannet:shape_dir` to unzipped ShapeNet directory). Run the following (after changing the `--config-path` in the bash file):

```bash
$ bash scripts/preprocess/process_scannet.sh
```

Post running preprocessing, the data structure should look like the following:

```
Scannet/
├── objects_chunked/ (object data chunked into hdf5 format for instance baseline training)
|   ├── train_objects.h5
|   └── val_objects.h5
├── scans/
|   ├── scene0000_00/
|   │   ├── data1D.npz -> all 1D data + encoded (object referrals + BLIP features) 
|   │   ├── data2D.npz -> all 2D data + encoded (RGB + floorplan + DinoV2 features)
|   │   ├── data3D.npz -> all 3D data + encoded (Point Cloud + I2PMAE features - object only)
|   │   ├── object_id_to_label_id_map.npz -> Instance ID to NYU40 Label mapped
|   │   ├── objectsDataMultimodal.npz -> object data combined from data1D.npz + data2D.npz + data3D.npz (for easier loading)
|   │   ├── sel_cams_on_mesh.png (visualisation of the cameras selected for computing RGB features per scan)
|   │   ├── floor+obj.png -> rasterized floorplan (top-down projection of the floor+obj.ply)
|   |   └── floor+obj.ply -> floorplan + CAD mesh
|   └── ...
```

### 3RScan

#### Running preprocessing scripts
Adjust the path parameters of `Scan3R` in the config files under `configs/preprocess`. Run the following (after changing the `--config-path` in the bash file):

```bash
$ bash scripts/preprocess/process_scan3r.sh
```

Our script for 3RScan dataset performs the following additional processing:

- 3D-to-2D projection for 2D segmentation and stores as `gt-projection-seg.npz` for each scan.

Post running preprocessing, the data structure should look like the following:

```
Scan3R/
├── objects_chunked/ (object data chunked into hdf5 format for instance baseline training)
|   ├── train_objects.h5
|   └── val_objects.h5
├── scans/
|   ├── 7f30f36c-42f9-27ed-87c6-23ceb65f1f9b/
|   │   ├── gt-projection-seg.npz -> 3D-to-2D projected data  consisting of framewise 2D instance segmentation
|   │   ├── data1D.npz -> all 1D data + encoded (object referrals + BLIP features) 
|   │   ├── data2D.npz -> all 2D data + encoded (RGB + floorplan + DinoV2 features)
|   │   ├── data2D_all_images.npz (RGB features of every image of every scan -- for comparison with SceneGraphLoc)
|   │   ├── data3D.npz -> all 3D data + encoded (Point Cloud + I2PMAE features - object only)
|   │   ├── object_id_to_label_id_map.npz -> Instance ID to NYU40 Label mapped
|   │   ├── objectsDataMultimodal.npz -> object data combined from data1D.npz + data2D.npz + data3D.npz (for easier loading)
|   │   └── sel_cams_on_mesh.png (visualisation of the cameras selected for computing RGB features per scan)
|   └── ...
```

### ARKitScenes

#### Running preprocessing scripts
Adjust the path parameters of `ARKitScenes` in the config files under `configs/preprocess`. Run the following (after changing the `--config-path` in the bash file):

```bash
$ bash scripts/preprocess/process_arkit.sh
```

Our script for ARKitScenes dataset performs the following additional processing:

- 3D-to-2D projection for 2D segmentation and stores as `gt-projection-seg.npz` for each scan.

Post running preprocessing, the data structure should look like the following:

```
ARKitScenes/
├── objects_chunked/ (object data chunked into hdf5 format for instance baseline training)
|   ├── train_objects.h5
|   └── val_objects.h5
├── scans/

|   │   ├── objectsDataMultimodal.npz -> object data combined from data1D.npz + data2D.npz + data3D.npz (for easier loading)
|   │   └── sel_cams_on_mesh.png (visualisation of the cameras selected for computing RGB features per scan)
|   └── ...
```

### MultiScan

#### Running preprocessing scripts
Adjust the path parameters of `MultiScan` in the config files under `configs/preprocess`. Run the following (after changing the `--config-path` in the bash file):

```bash
$ bash scripts/preprocess/process_multiscan.sh
```

Our script for MultiScan dataset performs the following additional processing:

- 3D-to-2D projection for 2D segmentation and stores as `gt-projection-seg.npz` for each scan.
